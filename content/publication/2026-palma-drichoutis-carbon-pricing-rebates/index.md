#abstract: 'Carbon pricing markets can significantly reduce CO\textsubscript{2} emissions if they garner enough public support. Cash rebates increase acceptance yet are fiscally costly. Using an online incentivized experiment, we show that participants reduce consumption and emissions when offered a cash rebate, with effects statistically identical to a 10% lottery-based rebate. Probabilistic rebates thus replicate full-rebate outcomes while conserving funds, offering a cost-efficient approach to enhance public support for carbon pricing.'

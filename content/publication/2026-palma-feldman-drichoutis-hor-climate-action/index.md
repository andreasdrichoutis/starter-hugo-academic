abstract: 'Higher order risk preferences, prudence and temperance, have been linked to decisions with uncertain outcomes in the real world. However, their role in explaining pro-environmental behavior remains largely unexplored. In this study, we investigate whether individual higher-order risk preferences predict real-world climate action. Participants allocated a fixed amount of money ($38) ---equivalent to the monthly carbon offset of a typical U.S. citizen--- between themselves and Compensators, a nonprofit organization that facilitates certified CO2 offsetting. To minimize experimenter-demand effects, the donation decision was made about three months prior to the risk-elicitation task. Risk elicitation tasks involved substantial outcomes (up to $110). We also collected widely used hypothetical allocation decisions (e.g., 1% of household income) and self-reported survey responses on climate-related attitudes and behaviors. We find that higher-order risk preferences do not predict climate action or attitudes. Political ideology is the sole factor consistently explaining the variation in climate-related attitudes and actions.  '

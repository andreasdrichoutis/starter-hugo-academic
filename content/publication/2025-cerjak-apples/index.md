abstract: "This study examines consumer preferences for organic and local apples by combining between- and within-subject design characteristics in a second price auction. Our empirical application combines provision of information regarding local and organic attributes of apples with a tasting stage. We find that a design that combines between and within-subject elements\textemdash a mixed-subject design\textemdash results in less noisy willingness-to-pay estimates as well as allows us to uncover significant heterogeneity in elicited premiums that would have been masked if we had drawn inferences from the between-subject or the within-subject treatments in isolation. Results highlight the gains that can be achieved by using a mixed-subject design in experimental auctions."
